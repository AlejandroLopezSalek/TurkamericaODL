> **TurkAmerica** is a high-performance educational platform engineered to bridge the linguistic gap for Spanish speakers learning Turkish. This project utilizes a sophisticated hybrid architecture, merging the lightning-fast performance of Static Site Generation (SSG) with the robustness of a scalable RESTful API. It integrates context-aware Artificial Intelligence to deliver a personalized, adaptive learning experience that evolves with the user.

## System Architecture

The ecosystem relies on a containerized microservices architecture, ensuring that every component is isolated, scalable, and secure by design.

### Core Components

1.  **Static Frontend (Eleventy Integration)**: The visual core is pre-rendered using **11ty** (Eleventy). This approach eliminates server-side rendering latency, drastically improving SEO, Time to First Byte (TTFB), and First Contentful Paint (FCP) metrics.
2.  **Enterprise-Grade REST API (Express.js)**: Manages dynamic business logic with a focus on security and maintainability:
    *   **Authentication & Authorization**: A robust system utilizing JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and OAuth2 (Google) policies.
    *   **State Management**: Complex tracking of user progress, adaptive curriculum unlocking, and study streaks.
    *   **Security Layer**: Implementation of `Helmet` for strict HTTP headers, Content Security Policy (CSP), and `express-rate-limit` to mitigate DDoS and brute-force vectors.
3.  **Design System (TailwindCSS)**: Deploys a utility-first design framework with a custom configuration (`tailwind.config.js`) to ensure strict visual consistency, responsive behavior across devices, and native dark mode support.

## Data Pipelines

### Authentication & Session Lifecycle

The following sequence diagram illustrates the secure authentication flow implemented within `/server/routes/auth.js`, adhering to industry best practices for credential handling.

```mermaid

    participant U as User
    participant FE as Frontend (Client)
    participant API as API (Express)
    participant DB as MongoDB

    U->>FE: Input Credentials
    FE->>API: POST /api/auth/login
    Note right of FE: Input Validation (Regex/Length)
    API->>API: Sanitize & Validate (Express-Validator)
    API->>DB: Find User & Compare Password (Bcrypt)
    DB-->>API: User Data
    API->>API: Generate Signed JWT (7 Days)
    API-->>FE: Token + User Profile
    FE->>FE: Secure Storage (LocalStorage)
    
    Note over U, FE: Session Established

    U->>FE: Access Lesson Content
    FE->>API: GET /api/lessons (Auth Header)
    API->>API: Verify JWT Middleware
    API-->>FE: Protected Resource
```

## DevOps Strategy & Continuous Deployment

We implement a streamlined yet robust CI/CD pipeline powered by automated shell scripting (`deploy.sh`) and process orchestration via PM2, ensuring zero-downtime deployments.

### Quality Assurance & Security Compliance

This codebase has been audited to meet professional development standards:

*   **SonarQube Compliance**: The code has passed static analysis for security hotspots, code smells, and technical debt.
*   **Dependency Integrity**: Strict usage of `npm ci` in production environments ensures that the deployed dependency tree matches the tested environment exactly (determinism).
*   **Input Sanitization**: All incoming data streams undergo rigorous sanitization via `mongo-sanitize` (to prevent NoSQL Injection) and `xss-clean` (to neutralize Cross-Site Scripting attacks).
*   **Error Handling**: A centralized global error handler masks stack traces in production, preventing sensitive information leakage.
